# Privacy Policy for Todoist Custom Sidebar
Last Updated: December 13, 2025

1. Overview Todoist Custom Sidebar ("the Extension") is a productivity tool designed to help you manage your Todoist tasks directly from a browser sidebar. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains how we handle your information.

2. Data Collection and Usage The Extension communicates directly between your web browser and the Todoist API. The developer of this Extension does not collect, store, or have access to your personal data, tasks, or API tokens.

API Tokens: To function, the Extension requires your Todoist API Token. This token is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API (chrome.storage.local). It is never transmitted to the Extension developer or any third-party servers other than the official Todoist API.

Task Data: The Extension fetches your tasks, projects, and labels directly from https://api.todoist.com. This data is displayed in your browser and is not collected or analyzed by the Extension developer.

Page Content: The "Add current page" feature accesses the title and URL of your active browser tab only when you explicitly click the button. This information is used solely to pre-fill the task creation field.

3. Third-Party Services The Extension integrates with the Todoist service (provided by Doist Inc.). Your use of Todoist is subject to Doist's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Extension acts solely as a client interface for your Todoist account.

4. Data Security Your API token is stored locally within your browser sandbox. We follow Chrome Extension best practices, including utilizing Manifest V3 security enhancements, to ensure your data remains secure on your device.

5. Changes to this Policy We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through the Extension's update notes or Chrome Web Store listing.

6. Contact If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the support link on the Chrome Web Store listing.
